Your product has not been approved for the following reason(s): [General Artist Credit Query] We believe either the release or track level credits are incorrect. It's vital you submit your product with contributors in the exact roles they play during the upload process. All information and assets submitted with a product should match between product, track and artwork level. It's worth noting that this also includes the artists' names order and the way they are credited (with, featuring, etc). Please do not submit track level credits as â€œVarious Artistsâ€. [Additional Notes] The current requirements for featuring artist metadata in Jazz releases are as follows: The ensemble members can be credited on the artwork, but not as featuring in the metadata. If you want to credit them individually in the metadata, you can only do so by assigning a contributor role according to their instrument (bass, drums, etc). Please select one of these as applicable, instead of using the Featuring designation. Where applicable, soloists should be noted using the soloist role in addition to their instrumental or performance role. These should be credited on each applicable track (if you wish to credit soloists). Please refer to the Recommended Contributor Roles for a list of appropriate roles to use for Jazz artists: https://help.apple.com/itc/musicspec/#/itca4c1f6563 If you still have questions or need further clarification, please reach out to your client representative or email orchardsupport@theorchard.com Once you've made the requested changes, re-submit the product via the Product Builder in your Workstation.

Through the process of copyright research, we have identified a number of tracks where we believe the underlying compositions to be medleys, despite being opted into our Mechanical Administration Service. Unfortunately, The Orchard is unable to provide its mechanical administration services for medleys, as such uses are not covered under the licensing provisions of the US Copyright Act and require prior approval from the original publishers of the musical works in advance of distribution. Please review this content and confirm whether these tracks are medleys in Column O on the attached. However, if these tracks turn out to not be medleys, please provide contact information in Column N. While generally we are unable to handle mechanicals for medley content, if you are able to provide us with documentation verifying that all relevant publishers have approved this instance, then we can continue with our licensing efforts. Otherwise, if documentation cannot be provided, please let us know how you would like to proceed from one of the options below: 1) Restrict/carve out distribution of the entire product within the US 2) Deliver a version of the product without the concerned tracks for sale within the US 3) Change the tracks in question to be available for streaming only Thank you very much!

As I remove this project, I need to get an accurate count so I can make a report to others who are financially involved in the project.

Let me know if it would be helpful to get you access to Ian's account as well. The Orchard back-end has a built-in multi-link tool using the ""Marketing"" tabâ€”he should just ""create a new landing page"" and it's pretty intuitive from there. This should have links for all DSP's populated for you to work with. I'm not seeing marketing highlights in the backend, fwiw. I am sending a screen recording so that he can see where to adjust both of the aforementioned items. Hopefully this gets you up and running, but if not, holler back and either client services or I will respond asap.

But one thing I wasnâ€™t sure about was because the account for FERGUSON will be new, is there a URI for Spotify and/or an Apple ID for Apple Music that will allow me to claim the FERGUSON page (like for editing how the profiles look on different streaming platforms)? I wasnâ€™t sure when it goes live Friday if there will be pictures, bio, etc. and if thats something I need to take care of or if they do it.

Just looking for a label https://on.soundcloud.com/MMSpVs1oUVMJS4os6 Heâ€™s with Wasserman (Jonathan Levin) and Patrick Clifford involved in A&R and has had decent press previously and some great live looks from Luck Reunion to Bonoraoo, music synced with Mayor Of Kings Town.. cool story previously with indie rock band Kingston Springs, and has been solo for a while now, searching for his sound and after many years has written of the greatest indie rock albums of the century! Incredible liveâ€¦ sounds like second coming of Paul McCartney with a bit of Ty Segal, Mac Demaco mixed in - has a very famous rock music uncle (GLOBALLY FAMOUS) that he hates talking about as wants to do it on his ownâ€¦ but could be convinced... Going on an adventure to Peru so going to film a lot of content out there for the album, while working on the next EP there... last piece of the puzzle is label - hoping you can help! No manager yet but Keith Hagan has expressed interest previously and I think he or others that have circled, would come onboard if a label deal was onto table Ideally looking for summer release date and then Wasserman would build a tour to follow - will have a plan from them to share soon Previous press; https://floodmagazine.com/138313/ian-ferguson-new-love-first-listen/ https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/ian-ferguson-state-of-gold-album-8523880/ IG: https://www.instagram.com/ianfergusonmusic/?hl=en <018.jpeg> Thanks!!

395993,Closed,Client Services,Peter Ward-Edwards,4/2/2025,3/3/2025,"Dear The Orchard Support Team, I hope youâ€™re doing well. Iâ€™m reaching out for clarification regarding a policy that has been communicated to me by Keep Hold Srl, a sub-distributor operating under The Orchard. I originally distributed my music through a sub-account under The Orchard, managed by Keep Hold Srl, with an agent (who is now unreachable) acting as the intermediary. I never signed a direct contract with Keep Hold or their partner company, yet they are refusing to remove my music from DSPs unless I either: 1. Pay a â‚¬3,000 penalty per song for immediate takedown, or 2. Wait until each release has been online for three years, as they claim this is a policy enforced by The Orchard. When I first contacted The Orchard's support team about removing my music, I was directed to Keep Hold, as I was told they are the ones who operate the sub-account. However, they are now stating that this three-year requirement is a policy set by The Orchard rather than their own terms. Given the conflicting information Iâ€™ve received, I want to verify directly: * Does The Orchard have an official policy requiring a three-year minimum distribution period before takedowns can be processed without penalty? * If so, could you provide written confirmation of this policy? * If not, could you clarify the proper process for removing releases that were originally distributed through a sub-account in which the operators are uncooperative? I want to ensure I am following the correct process and not being misled about policies that impact my rights as an independent artist. Any clarification you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

The Orchard provides many services but unfortunately, we do have A&R. We always leave the creative to our labels & artists and focus on the reach of the music. That said, if I hear of any Latin artists seeking collaboration or production aligned with your work I can give you a shout. I also recommend making a short list of artists or similar artists to get a better idea of what you're looking for.

Iâ€™ve just returned from the GRAMMYsâ€”while we didnâ€™t take home the gold this year, it was a major win for our tiny indie label to share a category with Mark Ronson/Sabrina Carpenter (the winners), Charli XCX, Shaboozey, Doechii, David Guetta, and Kaytranada. Iâ€™m reaching out because Iâ€™d love your help finding an Orchard-distributed Latin artist for an upcoming project. Perhaps you could connect me with your A&R team. Attached is the (untitled) track, which will be part of an album and is likely our second single. Our first single is slated for a March 21 release through The Orchard (Antaeus | FREEDOM | 199066618127). Thanks in advance, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

396547,Closed,Client Services,Peter Ward-Edwards,5/2/2025,10/2/2025,"Dear Team, The album of the artist ANA INIESTA ""Rebenque en flor"" UPC199066558171 appears in the workstation as â€˜sentâ€™ but not as â€˜completedâ€™. However, the release date has already passed, it was 31 January. I also don't see it as â€˜rejectedâ€™, so I would like to know what is going on and what is the reason for the delay. This album was uploaded with one less track in 2023 by another aggregator. The artist decided to cancel her contract with the previous aggregator and sign with us. I understand that once our version of the album is uploaded by us, the previous aggregator must take down the release to avoid losing the listens. Is this the case? We have used the same ISRCs and in the case of the release we uploaded, one more track was added that was not in the original release. many thanks for clarifying the situation regarding this release. regards, NICOLÃS FALCOFF",Technical Issue,High,48 hrs,Negative,199066558171,"Client reports that the album appears as 'sent' but not 'completed' despite the release date passing, and requests clarification on the delay and contract transition issues.",Technical Support,"Investigate the release status in the system, clarify the contract transition process, and update the client on the delay."
